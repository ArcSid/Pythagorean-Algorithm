# Pythagorean-Algorithm
this algorithm creates a graph using C++ and replit that represents the pythagorean theorem as coordinates
coordinates go as:
a,b
b,c
a,c
a,b b,c a,c
playing with these values result in some interesting geometric shapes and interesting graphs

••• How do i use this? •••
• go to replit (https://replit.com/@RaimundasNaujik/Pythagorean-Algorithm) <compiled project link OR https://replit.com/~
• create a C++ repl and open hidden files, copy and paste my 'replit.nix' file in their replit.nix file
• paste in the 'main.cpp' file in main.cpp
• create a 'graph.py' file (responsible for the graph) and paste my graph.py code in it.
• you are free to mess with this code as much as you like.


••• How Does It Work? •••
